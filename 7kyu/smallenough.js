// It's good to include a brief description of the function's purpose and expected behavior as a comment.

    // Consider validating input parameters, ensuring 'a' is an array and 'limit' is a number before proceeding with the logic.
  
    // The use of the spread operator (...) combined with Math.max makes the code concise.
    // However, it might be less efficient for large arrays. Consider an alternative approach for performance optimization.

    // Currently, the function would return true in such cases, which may not be the desired behavior.
